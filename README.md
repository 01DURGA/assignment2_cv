# Integral image & Real time panoramic image 

This repo has project related to the 
1) Canny edge & Harris corner detection - Canny edge detection and Harris corner detection are popular techniques for extracting important features from images. Canny edge detection identifies edges by reducing noise, calculating gradients, and applying thresholding, while Harris corner detection detects corners by analyzing changes in intensity. These techniques are crucial for tasks like object recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction, enabling the development of accurate and robust computer vision systems.
2) Integral image - The integral image is a technique used in computer vision to quickly calculate the sum of pixel intensities in rectangular regions of an image. In Python with OpenCV, you can use the cv2.integral() function to compute the integral image efficiently. This pre-computed image is useful for various tasks such as face detection, object recognition, and image statistics computation. By eliminating repetitive summing operations, the integral image speeds up the processing of features and enables real-time applications in computer vision, making it a valuable tool for tasks like object tracking and surveillance systems.
3) real time panoramic image - real-time panoramic image project implemented in Python using OpenCV combines computer vision techniques such as feature detection, matching, image warping, and blending to stitch multiple camera frames together seamlessly. By processing the camera feed in real-time, it creates a captivating panoramic image that dynamically adjusts as the camera moves, showcasing the power of OpenCV for immersive visual experiences.
